## Research 
I have focuesed most of my efforts in research towards the HI-SEAS experiment. I have been working on my own research into forecasting energy consumption in the habitat and its relationship with the crew emotional state. Thus far I have published:

1 Masters thesis <br>
2 journal articles (peer review)  <br>
7 Conference papers  <br>
2 Techical Documents <br>


### HI-SEAS

I was a participant in the first HI-SEAS study as a Crew Engineer and I lived in the dome for four months. Upon taking up the position as Graduate Assistant to Dr. Binsted, I helped operate and run next 4 experiments. This involved a lot of travel between Oahu and the Big Island. I would stay on the BI for exended periods watching the crew, running multiple logistical operations for setting up/tearing down the experiments. It was a large job with a lot of scientific studies happen that we had to ensure went as smoothly as possible. I also conducted my own research into forecasting energy consumption in the habitat and its relationship with the crew emotional state.

### Robotic Companion Study

I created and deployed a robotic companion study for the HI-SEAS experiment. I obtained and reprogrammed the robots myself, helped design the experiment, and collected data on the crew members. I then presented the results at the 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS ROBOTS in 2018, which was then published in the conference proceedings.

### Centaur Sentry Robot

The Centaur Sentry Robot was a project I worked on at the University of Calgary. I designed and developed a robotic platform for the purpose of security patrol applications in remote work areas. I conducted a lot of R&D looking at the economic feasibility of the application and also conducted interviews with secuirty companies to see what their interest level was, and how much of a market existed. Based on their needs I designed the robot and built it to the point where it was ready to be sent for production.

### Prairie Dog

The Prairie Dog is a robot platform I build while I was serving as a Combat Engineer in the Canadian Forces. I was seeing a number of my friends coming home with the bottom of one or both their legs missing from anti-personnel mines when they were checking areas for Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). I wanted a remote camera to be able to drive up to a dangerous location and have a look around prior to myself walking up. I self taught myself about robotics and constructed a small robot platform which came to be known as 'Prairie Dog'. I managed to finished the robot and bring with me to Afghanistan and used the robot in an operational setting. 

### Canadian Forces: Direct Action

While inbetween training sessions in the Canadian Army, I was placed in a small team to help develop a training video game called Canadian Forces: Direct Action. It was a multiplayer FPS that we modeled to be like the training areas. Basically, soldiers were able to play the video game against each other prior to entering into the real training area. It had some interesting results such as soldiers having devloped their own strategies amoung each other which went on display in the real training scenario. The game was produced on the Unreal game engine and I was helping program in the new equipment and modifiying the physics of the weapons to make them more realistic to our own. I also used the video game to create movies of tactical formations using the AI characters in the game. These videos are still being used to train troops prior to deployment today.
