**Forecasting of Energy Requirements for Planetary Exploration Habitats Using a Modulated Neural Activation Method**,*Engler S.*,Master Thesis, University of Calgary, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary Library Thesis Vault, (Mar 2017)

**Abstract:** Human travel to other planetary bodies will have duration of years, with little to no possibility
of resupply. Consequently, the monitoring and forecasting of resource consumption is a mission critical capability. The actions of a single crew member can heavily influence small environments and throw forecasting models off to the point of total failure. It is hypothesized that the inclusion of variables accounting for daily astronaut activities and psychological state will allow for higher accuracy in forecasting. Utilizing consumption data from the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog Simulation in the form of electricity, and psychological data from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, a generalized artificial neural-modulation method is introduced which allows the incorporation of emotional response into machine learning applied to forecasting. It is found that the changes in the activation functions correlate to observed crew behavior, and show significant improvement of forecasting results.

# Journal articles

**Mars habitat power consumption constraints, prioritization, and optimization**, Ansley, B., Engler, S.T., Binsted, K., Journal of Space Safety Engineering, Oct 31st, 2019 (In Press) doi.org/10.1016/j.jsse.2019.10.006

**Abstract:** The Hawai'i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) is an experiment simulating long-duration life in a Mars habitat. Power for the habitat is generated by a photovoltaic system that exhibits daily variation in production rates. During days with cloud cover, the crew need to adapt their work schedule and support systems to ensure they can continue to function under low-power constraints. This paper accordingly presents the development and implementation of power budget profiles for low-, medium-, and high-power production days during Mission 5 of the HI-SEAS experiment. The applied power budget profiles limit which systems and devices can be used and for what duration. To generate these profiles, the HI-SEAS power subsystem was first characterized though power audits and data from daily crew use trends. The methods used to determine a prioritized list of habitat equipment for crew-member usage and compliance with restrictions are then discussed. Finally, an optimization method is proposed to determine the most efficient schedule to match each power usage profile with respect to crew preferences. The data from this experiment provide a novel opportunity to gain insight into power usage in space exploration habitats, establishing a foundation for the development of proper power generation and management technologies. Thus, this research can be used to provide meaningful guidance to most manned space systems in ensuring optimal power consumption under a variety of power generation conditions.

**Abstract:** Travel to other planetary bodies represents a major challenge to resource management. Previous manned exploration missions of long duration have been resupplied with food, water, and air as required. Manned missions to other planetary bodies will have durations of years with little to no possibility of resupply. Consequently, monitoring and forecasting resource consumption are mission-critical capabilities. The Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, a long-duration planetary analog simulation, has recently completed its fifth long-term isolation mission conducted to assess the energy, food, and water needs of a six-person long-term planetary mission. This study presents a novel method for forecasting energy consumption, which incorporates the emotional state of the habitat crew. Gathered data show inhabitants in small environments can be influenced considerably by the actions of a single member. This can result in dramatic changes in consumption that could cause forecasting models to deviate to the point of total failure. Previous work found that inclusion of the daily activities and the psychological states of the crew allows for higher accuracy in long-duration forecasts. Currently, psychological assessments in the form of a Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and a generalized artificial neural modulation method are used to incorporate emotional response into machine learning forecast methods. Using these techniques and developments, a large-scale smart habitat control and forecasting system is proposed that will monitor, control, and forecast HI-SEAS habitat resources for future HI-SEAS missions. This new system requires the incorporation of psychological and physiological data of the crew, together with information on their activities and schedules.

**Abstract:** Travel to other planetary bodies represents a major challenge to resource management. Previous
manned exploration missions of long duration were resupplied with food, water, and air as required with
regular resupplies. Manned missions traveling to other planetary bodies will have duration of years, with
little to no possibility of resupply. Consequently, the monitoring and forecasting of resource consumption
is a mission critical capability. The Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS), a long
duration planetary analog simulation, has recently completed its fifth long term isolation mission gathering
energy, food, and water demands for a six manned planetary habitat crew. Energy consumption data from
five of the simulations are analyzed and discussed showing unique data sets for energy, food, and water
demands of a six man long term planetary mission. A novel method for forecasting energy consumption
will also be presented that incorporates the emotional state of the habitat crew. Gathered data show
that environments can be heavily influenced by the actions of a single crew member resulting in dramatic
changes in consumption, throwing forecasting models to the point of total failure. Previous work has shown
that the inclusion of the daily astronaut activities and psychological state allow for higher accuracy in
forecasting for longer duration. Currently psychological surveys in the form of Positive and Negative
Affect Schedule (PANAS), and a generalized artificial neural-modulation method are used to incorporate
emotional response into machine learning forecasting methods. Using these lessons and developments,
a large scale smart habitat control and forecasting system will be proposed that will monitor, control,
and forecast habitat resources for manned missions. This new system will require the incorporation of
psychological and physiological data from crew members, crew activities, and schedule.

**Planetary Habitat Systems Monitoring On a Mars Analog Mission**, *Engler S., Abrimov O., Binsted K., Hunter J., Leung H.*, 100 Year Starship Symposium: Pathway to the Stars, Footprints on Earth, Houston, TX. (2013)

**Abstract:** The NASA funded HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) is a planetary surface exploration analog site at ~8500 feet on the Mauna Loa side of the saddle area on the Big Island of Hawaii. This first mission will involve six astronaut-like (in terms of education, experience, and attitude) crew members living in the habitat for 120 days under Mars-exploration conditions. The habitat itself has been outfitted with a variety of real time sensors for water, heat, and energy consumption. This data shows a variety of traits within habitat living conditions that can be utilized for energy and water conservation. This mission started in February and will conclude on August 13th. Data of this type will give a picture of what resources are required for exploration or colonization on other planetary bodies. Future steps for habitat monitoring will be presenting outlining a data fusion model. This model will incorporate fuzzy logic for a centralized intelligent monitoring system.

**Benchmarking the 2D lattice Boltzmann BGK model**, *Engler S.*, Short communication. Amsterdam Center for Computational Science, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, (2001)

**Abstract:** A 2D Lattice Boltzmann BGK (LBGK) model on a D2Q9 lattice was constructed and tested foraccuracy in different physical situations. An introduction to the LBGK method is given followed by a detailed outline of the computer model construction.  Due to thefact that LBGK models arerestricted to low Reynolds numbers only laminar fluid flow is examined here. The model was tested for accuracy by comparing model output to the analytical solution of flow lines past a right circular cylinder. Next, plane Poiseuille flow through a 2D channel is compared to the analytical fluid flow and pressure solutions.
