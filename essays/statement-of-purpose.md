*This page presents my statement of purpose in computer science as required for the [ICS Ph.D. Portfolio](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/ph-d-in-ics/#phd-portfolio). It summarizes my professional interests in research, teaching, service, and/or product development.*

## Background and Research Interests
In 2009, while on deployment with the Canadian Army in Afghanistan, I fell into the world of robotics. Although I had a background in Astrophysics and Mathematics I joined the Army looking for adventure. I found myself in a very precarious job hunting for Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) trying to keep my fellow troops safe. While serving, I constructed my first robot, the Prairie Dog. This robotic platform remotely fed video and gave me GPS coordinates of objects of interest. It turned out to be the first robotic platform used in combat by Canada and is now on display in a Military museum in Calgary.
	After leaving the Army, I decided to study robotics full time. I enrolled in a M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Calgary.  I pursued studies in sensor networks, artificial intelligence, signal filtering, and stochastic mathematics. I designed and constructed a second robotic platform with the concept of augmenting guards for private security applications. I produced two conference publications with Unmanned Systems Canada, where I won the best student paper competition in 2011. I applied for and was awarded  Alberta Innovation Grant for marketing research of my robotic platform. I spent a summer working with Dr. Wettergreen at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I developed an Android tablet user interface for robotic platform using a Distributed Data Service (DDS) communications system. 
	
##  Goals
  I would like to look at methods for colonization of other planetary systems. I would look developing a centralized artificial intelligent system for a small colony that will organize the population so that it is able to produce the food and resources required. The HI-SEAS mission is closely integrated into this concept as I would develop an artificial intelligence system that is capable of monitoring the needs of the habitat.

## Progress
  I adapted my masters thesis to take the first steps in creating a centralized intelligent system. Using energy and resource consumption data within the HI-SEAS habitat, I used various forms of machine learning to forecast energy usage. I discovered that these forecasts would encounter critical and catastrophic errors when encountering sudden shifts in energy usage. Through the comparison of the cew schedule, psycological data (crew mood), and the forecast errors I was able to determine that the crew's mood was a strong factor in the concumption behavior. Using this info, I created a neural-modulation method that allowed for the incorporation of crew mood scores through altering activation functions within neural-networks. Using this as a starting point. Using the lessons I have learned from forecasting in the habitat, I want to look at ways of setting up and organizing a large scale human colony on Mars.
  To accomplish this, I will look at the latest research in system theory and artifically intelligent cities. I will look at the current plans for Mars colonization. I will also look at human colonies (isolated communities)  here on Earth, and those that are proposed for planetary habitation. From this I will select a organizational structure and develop an AI system to organize life within the colony.
