Field Trials and operational testing of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) prototypes were conducted in
Afghanistan. This project included the Miniature Unmanned Ground Vehicle (MUGV) prototype produced by
Defence Research and Development Canada â€“ Suffield (DRDC Suffield), the Prairie Dog UGV independently
designed and developed by Spr. Engler of 1 Combat Engineer Regiment, and the XMUTS-II UGV prototype
from the Australian Department of Defence. Each UGV was evaluated for its suitability and compatibility to
work with the environment and equipment seen in Afghanistan. Applications for the use of UGV in theatre were
identified. Trials of the UGV prototypes being used in these applications in operational conditions were
conducted. A comparison of the performance of each UGV was conducted in an attempt to identify strong/weak
design points. Using the experience and data gathered from the trials TTP were derived for each of the
operational applications. Finally, future requirements and a direction for further research and development are
outlined.
